Can you make me a nice looking "snackbar" component in plain js that I can call by using a js function.

Default behaviour

- colored background (multiple pre-defined colors) and a content (text or html)
- appears in upper right corner (can be changed via a function argument)
- appears for a default number of milliseconds (can be changed via a function argument)
- multiple snackbars appear "stacked" in the ui
